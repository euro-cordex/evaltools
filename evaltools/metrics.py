# BIAS: the difference (model − reference) of spatially
# averaged climatological annual or seasonal mean values
# for a selected subregion (relative difference for precipi-
# tation).

# 95 %-P: the 95th percentile of all absolute grid cell dif-
# ferences (model − reference) across a selected subre-
# gion based on climatological annual or seasonal mean
# values (relative difference for precipitation).

# PACO: the spatial pattern correlation between climato-
# logical annual or seasonal mean values of model and
# reference data across all grid points of a selected subre-
# gion.

# RSV: ratio (model over reference) of spatial standard de-
# viations across all grid points of a selected subregion of
# climatological annual or seasonal mean values.

# TCOIAV: temporal correlation of interannual variabil-
# ity between model and reference time series of spatially
# averaged annual or seasonal mean values of a selected
# subregion.

# RIAV: ratio (model over reference) of temporal standard
# deviations of interannual time series of spatially aver-
# aged annual or seasonal mean values of a selected sub-
# region.

# CRCO: Spearman rank correlation between spatially av-
# eraged monthly values of model and reference data of
# the climatological mean annual cycle of a selected sub-
# region.

# ROYA: ratio (model over reference) of yearly amplitudes
# (differences between maximum and minimum) of spa-
# tially averaged monthly values of the climatological
# mean annual cycle of a selected subregion.
